## Abstract

Remove the current TTOR (Topological Transactions Ordering) implicit rule, and
impose a canonical transactions order on blocks (transactions ordered by their
IDs in lexicographical order).


### Key terms

*   TTOR (Topological Transactions Ordering Rule): The transactions in a block
    are sorted in a way that, if a transaction `A` depends on `B`'s output, then
    `B` precedes `A`. This rule does not provide a [total order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order).
*   AOR (Any Ordering Rule): No restrictions are applied on how transactions are
    ordered in a block, any order is valid according to this rule.
*   CTOR (Canonical Transactions Ordering Rule): Mandatory total ordering rule.
*   LTOR (Lexicographic Transactions Ordering Rule): Specific case of a CTOR.
    Transactions are ordered using their ID as a key, in lexicographical order.
*   GTOR (Gavin's Transactions Ordering Rule): Specific case of a CTOR.
    Transactions in a block follow a topological order, but when a transaction
    `A` is not ancestor nor descendant of a transaction `B`, their relative
    order is given by their IDs, which MUST follow the lexicographical order.


## Motivation

Currently, when a proposer builds a block, or a relay node validates a block, it
has to take into account the transactions topological order.

Getting rid of the topological ordering rule makes it easier to parallelize
blocks' validation by applying the OTI (Outputs-then-Inputs) algorithm. It is
possible to implement an OTI variant that works on TTOR, but requires keeping
track of transaction indices in additional data structures, and a final extra
check to ensure that the topological order is maintained [[1]](#references).

Having a canonical order eases the introduction of better block propagation
techniques, like Graphene [[2][3][4]](#references), and allows for compact
transaction inclusion/exclusion proofs applying algorithms to tackle the "set
reconciliation problem" [[5][6]](#references).

CTOR also enables the possibility of implementing simple and effective sharding
techniques. By having a well known order, transactions can be grouped and
locally processed in different threads or processes, taking advantage of
multi-core and multi-processor systems. This applies to mempool acceptance,
blocks validation and Merkle trees construction [[7]](#references).

More specifically, LTOR gives us a simple rule on how to partition shards (by
hash or ID prefix), and opens the door to efficiently use Merklix trees
[[8][9][10]](#references), a special case of Merkle trees (they are
constructed like a trie, or radix tree). Merklix trees are interesting because
they allow us to create presence or absence proofs for the whole represented
set, while generic Merkle trees only allow us to create proofs for specific
positions/indices.

As an extra "side effect" of implementing LTOR, protocol & implementations get
slightly simplified, making testing easier, and making harder to design attacks
based on "block malleability" (i.e. hash-flooding[[11]](#references) or timing
attacks, immunity to hash-flooding attacks would be trivial by using trees
instead of hash tables for the mempool).

It is also worth to say that in our case, with a target spacing (expected time
between blocks) of 16 seconds, the probability of having "0-conf" transactions
is even lower than in Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash, so the topological ordering
property will hold with high probability at the intra-block level even if it's
not proactively enforced (which, in any case, is not a real advantage).

### CTOR, Graphene and propagation times

As users of Unit-e, we only care about which transactions belong or don't belong
to a block, but not about its order (we think in terms of sets, not in terms of
lists), but a specific order is required to construct the Merkle tree that will
be used to build the header.

By not having to specify the transactions order (because it's implicit) at the
time of block propagation, we have to send less data. If we have `n`
transactions in a block (without considering the coinbase transaction), we have
`n!` different ways to sort them, so in the ideal case, encoding this
information would take `log2(n!)` bits (i.e., for 1000 transactions we need at
least 1.04KB, and 14.46KB for 10000).

The Graphene[[2]](#references) block propagation method (designed to decrease
block propagation times) relies on sending an invertible bloom lookup
table[[12]](#references) and a
[Bloom filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter) in order to specify
the block's transactions set.

These lightweight probabilistic data structures carry lossy-compressed
information about the transactions set, but don't provide any hint about its
order. We can obtain the order by different means:

*   Relying on a canonical order: In this case, there's no extra overhead.
*   Passing an explicit order: This would tamper Graphene's benefits as it
    would increase messages' sizes. As an example, for 2000 transactions,
    Graphene would need approximately `2.1KB`, adding the explicit order it
    would need `2.1KB + 2.3KB = 4.4KB`, more than doubling the message's size.
*   Hard-coding different ordering methods and specifying which one is being
    used: This option adds extra complexity and maintenance burden without
    providing known benefits.

Notice how AOR only allow us to apply the 2nd and 3rd option, while CTOR allows
to implement Graphene with zero overhead.

## Specification

*   All transactions in a block (except for the coinbase transaction, which must
    be the first one) MUST be in lexicographical order (using their ID as key).
    The order is relevant at the time of constructing the transactions Merkle
    tree.
*   The implementation MUST NOT rely on the topological order assumption in any
    of its steps.
*   Using the OTI algorithm is a good starting point, but it's also possible to
    implement parallel variants of the same idea.
*   In case of block disconnection and/or chain reorganizations, the OTI
    algorithm has to be applied in reverse order (Inputs-then-Outputs).

## Rationale

### Considered alternatives

Among the different known possibilities, LTOR has the best balance:

*   TTOR: Does not provide any of the advantages presented in the *Motivation*
    section, and keeping a topological order does not scale well as the number
    of transaction grows [[13][14]](#references).
*   AOR: It gives us the possibility to implement some parallelization
    improvements, but does not help with sharding or block "malleability", and
    in the case of block propagation times it would require to change the Merkle
    root construct as well (for example using Merklix trees).
*   GTOR: Although it's almost equivalent to LTOR, its implementation is more
    complex, and applying sharding is not as easy as with LTOR.

### Prior work & community support

Prior research work on the topic has been done by the Bitcoin Cash community
[[7][15]](#references), and CTOR has been implemented at November 2018 as a hard
fork[[16]](#references).

### Known concerns

*   Less sources of entropy: In the case of PoW, some miners argued that they
    would have less sources of entropy to generate good enough hashes, but this
    does not apply to Unit-e because it's PoS-based.
*   Some developers argued that there's still room for improvement for TTOR, and
    that it would be worth to exhaust the solutions space before switching to
    CTOR/LTOR. It's true that some processing speed could be gained, but
    choosing micro-optimizations & speculative improvements over clear & known
    improvements on the data structures & algorithms does not seem reasonable
    from an engineering perspective.


## Backwards compatibility

There are no backwards compatibility problems.
